Jason is a farm kid at heart, building technology companies for the past 10+ years. Somewhere between cleaning out corn bins and throwing hay bales in the summer sun he decided to create companies he could run from a laptop and an internet connection. Paired with his early experience building custom computers and hosting LAN parties this has led to founding Revelar, the first NFT Game Engine on Cardano. \
\
This guide is a foundation of Jason & Revelar's commitment to building sustainable and low cost hardware for remote regions to help secure and validate Cardano's network. Plus, you can't seem to take the farm kid out of the tool shop forever.. \
