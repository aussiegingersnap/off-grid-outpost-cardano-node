  This guide assumes you have completed (or will) the deployment of a Raspberry
  Pi Cardano node. The focus of this off-grid guide is the thoughts and approach
  to building your own Solar powered setup.

# Setup Guides

### Our Current Setup

For this guide we have modified the Armada Alliance Raspi-Node guide for our own development uses as early minting node for Revelar. We have documented a full start to deployment guide as part of another Catalyst Fund 7 Proposal we were awarded. If you want to follow along with our build exactly as we have setup ours, please use this guide:

{% hint style="info" %}
It is good advice to setup and run a node locally before getting off grid, as there are some early syncing decisions to make before taking it out in the bush and relying on more variable to troubleshoot.&#x20;
