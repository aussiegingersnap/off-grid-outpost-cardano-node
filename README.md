  Welcome everyone to a guide on exploring new off-grid solutions for Cardano
  node deployment. The vision behind off-grid solutions like this is to
  encourage and allow for greater decentralization.

# â˜€ Getting Off-Grid with Cardano

{% hint style="info" %}
**Focus on Decentralization:** As with any Cardano node deployment there are many elements to manage. For this guide we are starting with an existing Node setup using Raspberry Pi's and focusing on the enclosure and hardware to support this with the primary focus on decentralization from electrical grid needs. \
\
_Naturally you should expect to manage tradeoffs with this approach, which we will make note of._
{% endhint %}

\
Welcome to the experiment! This guide is a work in progress starting March 4th, 2020 -- TBD as a funded project from Catalyst Fund 7. **Please share and discuss improvements that can be made!**\
