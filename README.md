  Welcome everyone to a guide on exploring new off-grid solutions for Cardano
  node deployment. The vision behind off-grid solutions like this is to
  encourage and allow for greater decentralization.

# ‚òÄ Getting Off-Grid with Cardano (WIP)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Focus on Decentralization:** As with any Cardano node deployment there are many elements to manage. For this guide we are starting with an existing Node setup using Raspberry Pi's and focusing on the enclosure and hardware to support this with the primary focus on decentralization from electrical grid needs. \
\
_Naturally you should expect to manage tradeoffs with this approach, which we will make note of._
{% endhint %}

### Welcome to the experiment!

This guide is a work in progress (WIP) starting March 4th, 2020 -- TBD as a funded project from Catalyst Fund 7. **Please share and discuss improvements that can be made!**\
****\
**Who this guide **<mark style="color:green;">**is for**</mark>**:**

* Tinkerers who want to improve Cardano's decentralization.
* Makers who are looking to understand the nuances for Cardano node power requirements
* Students and Teachers looking for a hands on project to learn about Cardano
* Remote towns or villages without access to cloud computing services
* Hackers (the good kind) & developers who want to build bare metal and off grid
* Fans of Solar power! üå§Ô∏è

**This guide is **<mark style="color:red;">**not**</mark>

* Setting up a Cardano Node (although resources are [linked)](broken-reference)
* Designed to meet your local supply chain availability (use it as core principles) &#x20;
