# Materials Needed

{% hint style="warning" %}
This build has changed from the prototype version used in our PoC for the Fund 7 Proposal for two main reasons: #1 Supply Chain disruption, #2 Cost optimization (March 2022). \
\
Parts were sourced primarily via Amazon in North America for accessibility and ease for an end user and not full cost optimization, meaning experienced DIYers hunting for the best deals can probably save 12-15% more.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



Assembly of this enclosure is designed to be a balance between Maker DIY cost efficiencies and off the shelf hardware. A basic understanding of hand tools, power safety, and networking is required to fully assemble this enclosure.
